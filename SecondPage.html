        <h2>Types of Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>There are many different styles of rock climbing depending on the climber's personal preferences and available locations.
          The two main categories of climbing are Bouldering and Roped Climbing. The large varieties of styles all share certain aspects in common.
          They all follow a set route with the goal of reaching the top of the wall using only certain pre-defined holds. These styles can also be
          completed in indoors gyms or outdoor rock walls, except for one style in this list.
        </p>
        <p>There are many more styles of rock climbing than the ones mentioned on this list, however these are the most popular.
        <h3 class = 'subheader'>Roped Climbing</h3>
        <h3>Top Roping</h3>
        <p>Top Roping is the style of climbing most often used by beginners and in climbing gyms. Top Roping involves using a rope that has
          already been run though a pre-existing anchor point at the top of the wall. The climber will then be attached to the rope on one end
          and a belayer to the other end. The belayer will remove the excess rope (or slack) as the climber ascends the wall. Removing this slack
          means that if the climber falls they will be caught quickly by the rope without falling very far. Since the rope catches the climber early
          Top Roping is the safest form of climbing.
        </p>
        <p>The anchor point used for top roping will be set by staff when visiting an indoor gym. However, when climbing outdoors the top anchor
          will either be set by an experienced climber that lead climbs up (more below) or by accessing the top of the wall by foot if possible.
        </p>
        <h3>Lead Climbing</h3>
        <p>Lead Climbing is a more advanced style than Top Roping, with no anchor set at the top of the wall the climber must place their own
          anchors as they climb. As the climber ascends the wall they must hook the rope into anchor points that will catch them if they were to
          fall. Lead climbing still uses a belayer, who will remove the slack from the rope attempting to reduce the length of the fall. However,
          the climber will sometimes be above their highest anchor point, leading to much longer falls before the rope catches them.
        </p>
        <p>There are two categories of lead climbing: Sport climbing and Trad(traditional) climbing.</p>
        <div id="leadClimbing">
          <h4>Sport Climbing</h4>
          <p>Sport climbing is a type of lead climbing where there are already bolts placed in the wall. Climbers can then hook their quickdraws
            (slings with carabiners attached) to the bolts, these will then be used as the anchor points. This is the type of lead climbing that
            is used in indoor gyms and used for popular outdoor routes.
          </p>
          <h4>Trad Climbing</h4>
          <p>Trad climbing is also a type of lead climbing, however there is no pre-placed equipment on the wall. Climbers must place their own
            anchor points onto the wall as they ascend. The anchor points will typically be placed in cracks in the rock that appear solid enough to
            hold a fall. This can sometimes lead to long gaps with no anchor points. This type of climbing is only done on outdoor walls, since
            indoor gyms have laready placed all of the necessary equipment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class = 'subheader'>Bouldering</h3>
        <p>Bouldering is the only type of climbing on this ist that does not involve any rope. Due to not using a rope bouldering routes are much
          shorter and closer to the ground than other styles. This means that climbers are safe using only crash matts to protect themselves from a fall.
          Since bouldering problems are much shorter than traditional climbing they are also harder. Requiring climbers to attempt the same move multiple times
          before being able to complete it regularly. This can lead to people working on the same route for many days in a row trying to figure out how
          to complete each move and how to string them together.
        </p>
        <p>Bouldering can be great for beginners since it does not require as much training and equipment as the other methods of climbing. There is no necessary
          equipment to boulder, although climbing shoes and chalk can help. This means that anyone who would like to start climbing can freely try bouldering.
          Bouldering can also be a good starting point for people who are afraid of heights, since you will rarely get more than a couple meters off the ground.
