        <h2>What is Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>Rock climbing is a sport that many people around the world enjoy. It involves attempting to reach the top of a rock wall
          (man-made or natural) using a set of predefined foot and hand holds, called routes. Rock climbing will test a person's physical
          and mental strength. Climbers need to be strong enough to get to the top of the wall and smart enough to determine the best
          way to accomplish this goal.
        </p>
        <p>Rock climbing has been around for a very long time in some form or another. In acient times explorers and mountaineers utilized
          climbing techniques to traverse dangerous and steep areas of nature. Over time rock climbing became its own sport instead of a
          means to an end. Now many larger towns have climbing gyms being built so that everyone can enjoy the thrill of rock climbing.
          There are also climbing competitions all over the world and people competing to climb the hardest routes possible.
        </p>
        <p>While rock climbing may seem daunting it is a very accessible sport with a very friendly community. To get started all that is
          needed is to find a wall and some people to climb with and get going. This website will help inform you about various aspects of
          the sport and how to best get started.
