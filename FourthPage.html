        <h2>Equipment Needed to Climb</h2>
        <ul>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Climbing Shoes: </b>These shoes are much stiffer than traditional shoes and typically fit much smaller. This combination
              of features means that wearing them mamkes it much easier to place your feet on small foot holds.
            </li>

          </div>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Chalk Bag: </b>Chalk is used to keep your hands dry to prevent them from slipping when climbing for long periods of time.
              Chalk Bages allow you to bring your chalk with you on the wall by clipping it to your harness.
            </li>

          </div>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Harness: </b>Climbing harnesses are used to attach yourself to the rope if you are climbing or attach yourself to the belay
              device if you are the one belaying.
            </li>

          </div>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Belay Device: </b>Belay devices are used to remove the slack from the clibmer's rope and keep them safe. There are two
              types of belay devices, GriGris and ATCs.
            </li>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <div class="gearList">
              <li><b>GriGri: </b>A GriGri is the more expensive of the two belay devices, however they have many more safety mechanisms if
                something were to go wrong.
              </li>

            </div>
            <div class="gearList">
              <li><b>ATC: </b>An ATC is the less expensive option compared to a GriGri, they have a much simpler design however this comes at the
                cost of losing safety mechanisms.
              </li>

        <h3>Outdoor only gear</h3>
        <ul>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Climbing Grade Rope: </b>Rope is needed to keep the climber safe, climbing rope is stretchy and durable allowing for repeated use
              without breaking. A good rope will mean that even long fall will not be too uncomfortable. Indoor climbing gyms will already have ropes
              in place meaning that you only need your own rope if you intend to climb outdoors.
            </li>

          </div>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Quickdraws: </b>Quickdraws are needed for lead climbing to attach your rope to the pre-paced anchor points. Some climbing gyms
              will already have quickdraws or similar equipment in place, thus they are mostly needed for outdoor climbing.
            </li>

          </div>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Helmet: </b>When climbing outdoors a helmet is often necessary since loose rocks above you may fall, causing serious damage if unprotected.
            </li>

          </div>
          <div class="gearList">
            <li><b>Cams: </b>Cams are used in trad climbing as your anchor points. They can be easily be placed in cracks on the wall to offer
              support for your safety rope.
            </li>
